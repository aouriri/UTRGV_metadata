The Authority Control Task List provides more details regarding authority record updates and the authority control process that are relevant to the institution's bibliographic record headings.

The Authority Control Task List makes it easier to manage cataloging maintenance tasks. Specifically, this list highlights authority headings updates that require manual intervention. Lack of authority control in the catalog can happen for a few different reasons, among them: 

* An authority record is deleted and the heading in corresponding bib records becomes unlinked, 
* A bib record is imported into the catalog and
  * No authority record corresponds to one or more headings
  * There appears to be several possible authority records that match the heading and Alma cannot determine the best option **(ambiguous)**

The Authority Control Task List only goes back 6 months (i.e., it only pulls data from bib records imported in the past 6 months or less and/or data from bib records where corresponding authority records changed in the past 6 months or less)  Thus, ***it is essential that Authority Control Task List reports be run on a monthly basis*** so that we have a record of historical instances where headings in bib records failed to match.  This enables us to manually fix such instances as time allows.
