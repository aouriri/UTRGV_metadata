Alma's Authority Control Task List retrieves instances where one or more headings in a bib record failed to link to a corresponding authority record.  At present it is the only way to locate bib records that contain unlinked headings within Alma.

The Authority Control Task List only goes back 6 months (i.e., it only pulls data from bib records imported in the past 6 months or less and/or data from bib records where corresponding authority records changed in the past 6 months or less)  Thus, *it is essential that Authority Control Task List reports be run on a monthly basis* so that we have a record of historical instances where headings in bib records failed to match.  This enables us to manually fix such instances as time allows.
