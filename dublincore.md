**Dublin Core Metadata Terms**<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

For the digital collections and institutional repository at UTRGV, most of the elements and some qualifiers in Dublin Core are employed. Additionally, encoding schemes such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings [(LCSH)](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html), are used implicitly or explictly (see example below) in further describing an object.
