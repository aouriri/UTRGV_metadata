From the All tab, click on a title to view a bib record, then proceed to Edit if needed. If you are on the Review tab, you may go directly to Edit in the option menu on the right.  
You may choose to edit multiple records across multiple pages in the task list, up to 100 records by selecting the check box and choosing from the option menu on the right. (The option only available in the Review tab).

When using the Edit option in the option menu from the Task List, the record is opened in the Metadata Editor, with the cursor in the field that has the issue

The field with the issue will have a green background color, though this may be difficult to see because your cursor is placed in that field.

If there are additional fields in the record with issues, they are also highlighted in a different color.

Make sure to release the record when you are done with it.

Using Dismiss all: This option will only dismiss the list you are currently viewing (e.g. if you have filtered or faceted, only those results will be dismissed). 

The Dismiss option is only available in the Review tab.
