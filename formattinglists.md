Individual instances of unlinked headings need to be manually reviewed and either edited (where possible) or noted (when no corresponding authority record exists or when the reviewer cannot determine which authority record is suitable).

*Resources needed*

* Alma
* [Library of Congress Authorities](authorities.loc.gov)
* Excel
* OCLC's [WorldCat Identities](https://www.worldcat.org/identities/) is also helpful

*Step-by-step guide*
1. Open both Alma and the LC Authorities page in your web browser.
2. Open the Excel file you plan to work with.
4. Go to the LC Authorities page.  Paste the text and search for it.
5. If a result displays but there is **NO** Authorized Heading or References button to the left, that means that no authority record currently exists for this term. In these instances you'll type an 'x' in the "No AR?" column.
6. Before editing bib records, check to see if it is for an e-Resource. This is common for the LCSH list (655 field) Right now, there is no need to edit bib records for electronic resources. If in doubt, reach out to either John Asbell or Dan McGinniss. 
  * To filter out or hide electronic resources in the Excel sheet, highlight/select the "BIB Heading" column > choose the "Sort & Filter" option under the Editing section > select "Filter" > click the dropdown symbol now available next to the "BIB Heading" cell > uncheck the "Select All" button > scroll down to find the electronic options, usually "Electronic books" and "Electronic journals" > check the electronic options available > you will be left with records that have electronic resource headings
  * You can either use the "Fill color" option to highlight those cells and keep them visible or you can de-select them under the "BIB Heading" filter, keeping all of the other headings.
7. For the records that do not have an authorized heading, they can be dismissed in Alma. For the records that have an authorized heading, select the record in Alma > click the ... (ellipsis) > click "Edit" and the record will open in the Metadata Editor at the point where the issue exists.
