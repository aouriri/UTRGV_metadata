# UTRGV Metadata
> [Temporary] site to document metadata workflows and guidelines for UTRGV digital assets.

The UT Rio Grande Valley metadata department actively promotes metadata-based digital resource management, monitoring national and international standards-related activities and conducting research into the theoretical and practical applications of metadata. Our goal is to provide optimum searching, discovery, and retrieval of information by users of our digital collections, while ensuring long-term preservation and viability of the digital objects in our systems. We employ a system of metadata developed in-house and based on qualified Dublin Core metadata elements.

Special thank you to the University of North Texas Libraries' Digital Projects Unit for publicly publishing their metadata workflow and documentation, which guided the creation of this guide.
