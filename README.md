# UTRGV Metadata
> *Temporary* site to document metadata workflows and guidelines for UTRGV digital assets.

The UT Rio Grande Valley metadata department actively identifies and oversees the creation and maintenance of descriptive, technical, and preservation metadata for the UTRGV Library, its digital collections, and its institutional repository. Additionally, the department creates, enhances, and performs quality control on non-MARC metadata for digital collections while adhering to local policies and international metadata standards and best practices, as well as conducting research into the theoretical and practical applications of metadata. Our goal is to provide optimum searching, discovery, and retrieval of information by users of our digital collections. We employ a system of metadata based on qualified Dublin Core metadata elements.

Special thank you to the University of North Texas Libraries' Digital Projects Unit for publicly publishing their metadata workflow [(link to UNT University Libraries Digital Projects Unit metadata section)](https://library.unt.edu/digital-projects-unit/metadata/) and documentation, which guided the creation of this guide.
